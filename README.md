# reddit_bot

## What is this?
This application was created to automatizate posting activity in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) social network.<br>
Application was written on C# with Windows Forms interface.<br>
To link with reddit i used open-source [Reddit.NET](https://github.com/sirkris/Reddit.NET) library.

## What can it do?
With this application you can select the 'pool' of subreddits you are going to post and create a couple of post templates. Choose the count, order, time interval of publishing, and account to publish from. <br>
The most of features of posting were implemented: Post and Link types, Flairs, Marks of content type. <br>
There is also present the output of publishing proccess, log file and detached log window for logs analyzing.

## A couple tips you should know before use
- Create the Reddit application of your account [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlWhLyVgN2s&ab_channel=KrisCraig). Use your credentials to connect reddit accout.
- Don't publish a lot of posts without the time interval. Reddit may think you are bot :)
- Data store at the project's root directory. There you can also find file errors.txt where you can check unexpected errors.
- The interface was written in my native ukrainian language, well don't afraid of it :)

Good Luck ^_^
